# News

- Update on _Dec 18, 2024_: I will be giving a lightning talk at JuliaCon 2025 to introduce TrixiCUDA.jl to the Julia community.

- Update on _Dec 12, 2024_: I will be mentoring a new GPU-related project with [@jlchan](https://github.com/jlchan) as part of Google Summer of Code 2025.

# Star Work

I love open source development, and I'm working as:

- Owner/Lead developer of [Trixi-GPU](https://trixi-gpu.github.io/), providing GPU acceleration support for solving hyperbolic PDEs, with a current focus on the semidiscretization process of the solvers.

- Host of the organization's webpage [trixi-gpu.github.io](https://trixi-gpu.github.io/).

- Member/Active maintainer of [Trixi-Framework](https://github.com/trixi-framework/), providing low-precision (single-precision and half-precision) numerical type stability support for solving hyperbolic PDEs on CPUs.

- Contributor of [JuliaGPU](https://github.com/juliagpu), open source software GPU computing in Julia.

- Contributor of [SciML](https://github.com/SciML), open source software for scientific machine learning.

- Contributor of [RAPIDS](https://github.com/rapidsai), open source software for GPU-accelerated data science.

- [JuliaCon 2025](https://juliacon.org/2024/) conference attendee.

- [JuliaCon 2024](https://juliacon.org/2024/) proposal reviewer.

- [Google Summer of Code 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2023/projects/upstR7K2) contributor.

# More...

Here is my recent [resume](/assets/files/resume.pdf) (Last updated: November 29, 2024).

Regarding math, I love both analysis and proofs. I recommend [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis) for its rigor and elegance. It is perfect for beginners in analysis and proofs.
